WebRTC-video
============

Proof-of-concept peer-to-peer video using the HTML5 Javascript API webRTC video engine

This is a demo of the new webRTC functonality in your browser. You can make video calls now without any plug-ins!!

There are tons of webRTC demos on the web. I wanted to do webRTC video too!

This demo simplifies everything outside of the client functionality. We use AJAX and a MySQL database for signalling.

The point is to get browser video to work, and to organize it in client-side data structures.
